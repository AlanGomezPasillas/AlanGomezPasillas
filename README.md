- ⚡ Fun facts:

  Once, I hacked my mom's tv... Let me explain, my brother lives upstairs my house, he lives with my mom,
  my brother likes high volume music with "Corridos Tumbados, Peso Pluma, Regueton" on it, it really makes me feel nauceous xd,
  so, every time my brother listened to that music, I sent a DoS to my mother's tv and then I pretended I didn't know
  what was happening, jeje really fun... (never got caught x3)
  
  Other more... I used to work in a call center serving to a cable company, with my developer creativity, innovation,
  and skills I made a new useful tool to make my work faster(and it really worked), the thing is, I was so proud of my own tool that
  I shared it to everyone on the work chat... bad idea, they blacklisted my tool's URL, so now I wasn't able to use it even for me,
  so I move it to another URL in my host to keep using it and I learnt that sometimes, even if you want to help, think twice
  before doing something or just ask to your team leader...
